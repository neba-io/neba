    <header><h1>NEBA 5.0.0 released</h1></header>
    <p>
        With 5.0.0, NEBA introduces a flyweight core and becomes independent of the Spring Framework. The Spring integration, albeit optional, is now available as a dedicated module and is upgraded to Spring 5.
        At the same time, the API has been partially restructured and simplified.

    <section>
        <header><h3>NEBA 5.0.0 becomes independent of the Spring Framework</h3></header>
        <p>
           The recent versions of AEM have seen a growing ecosystem of production-quality open source solutions, e.g. <a href="https://github.com/Adobe-Consulting-Services/acs-aem-commons">ACS commons</a> or
            <a href="https://sling.apache.org/documentation/bundles/models.html">Sling models</a> which form a solid foundation for many projects. Likewise, the trade-of between the footprint of the Spring integration
            and the features gained by the integration became smaller.
        </p>
        <p>
            Here, we choose to provide NEBA's core functionality with two lightweight bundles and make the Spring integration optional. Without using Spring, all it takes is a model annotated with <a href="/apidocs/neba-api/io/neba/api/annotations/RceModel.html">@ResourceModel</a> and the <a href="/documentation.html#add_neba_packages_header">OSGi bundle header
            <code>Neba-Packages</code></a> to point to the respective package.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you want to continue using the Spring Framework, rest easy: You can
            still deploy NEBA and the Spring integration with <a href="/download.html#spring-integration">one simple CRX package or delivery bundle</a>.
        </p>

    <section>
        <header><h3>Cleaner, simpler API</h3></header>
        <p>
            NEBA's API is now even more consise: A dedicated <em>SPI</em> (Service Provider Interface) package contains all extensions points in the form of service interfaces.
            The <em>services</em> package, on the other hand, contains interfaces of services published by NEBA. The <em>annotations</em> package remains largely unchanged and continues
            to provide NEBA's core functionality via semantic annotations. The notable exception is the <code>@PostMapping</code> annotation, which has been renamed to <a href="/apidocs/neba-api/io/neba/api/annotations/AfterMapping.html">@AfterMapping</a> - both for clarity and to
            avoid using the same name as Spring's REST annotation for HTTP POST MVC mappings.
            Release 5.0.0 also introduces the <a href="/apidocs/neba-api/io/neba/api/annotations/Filter.html">@Filter</a> annotation, which allows filtering OSGi services injected into resource models.
        </p>

        <header><h3>Even Faster</h3></header>
        <p>
            Performance and scalability have always been a key design goal of NEBA, as it is used in many large-scale Content Management deployments. With 5.0.0, NEBA ships a lightning-fast factory for models
            not managed in a Spring Application Context.

    <section>
        <header><h3>Update to Spring 5</h3></header>
        <p>
            The NEBA Spring integration is upgraded to Spring 5, the current GA version of the <a href="https://spring.io/projects/spring-framework">Spring Framework</a> (<a href="https://jira.spring.io/jira/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=10000&version=16753">release notes</a>).
            This includes an upgrade to <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/gemini/blueprint/">Gemini Blueprint 3.0.0</a> (<a href="http://git.eclipse.org/c/gemini.blueprint/org.eclipse.gemini.blueprint.git/plain/changelog.txt?h=3.0.0.M01">release notes</a>).

        <header><h3>Simple rules for dependency injection and content mapping</h3></header>
        <p>
            NEBA follows a simple rule: <code>@Inject</code> is for OSGi services, NEBA annotations are for content mapping. Of course, users of NEBA's Spring module can continue leveraging all
            capabilities of the Application context to inject their models.
        </p>

        <header><h3>Revised documentation</h3></header>
        <p>
            Along with the 5.0.0 release, NEBA also release a new website that adheres to the same principles as NEBA: Simplicity and performance. For this release, the <a href="/documentation.html">Documentation</a>
            has been restructured, revised and extensively updated.
