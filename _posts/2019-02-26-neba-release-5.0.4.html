    <header><h1>NEBA 5.0.4 released</h1></header>
    <p>
        NEBA 5.0.4 ships with out of the box support for the <a href="https://github.com/ist-dresden/composum">Apache Sling Composum Console</a> which is the advanced
        <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/experience-manager/6-4/sites/developing/using/developing-with-crxde-lite.html">CRXDE</a> replacement included in
        the <a href="https://sling.apache.org/downloads.cgi">Sling starter distributions</a>.
        The <a href="/documentation.html#tooling_modelregistry">Model registry</a> now automatically links resolvable sling resource types to the composum console, if it is available.
    </p>
    <p>
        In addition, the <a href="/documentation.html#tooling_modelregistry">Model registry</a> now tests whether <a href="https://docs.adobe.com/docs/en/spec/jcr/1.0/4.8_Node_Types.html">JCR primary node types or mixin node types</a> referenced by resource models exist,
        thus allowing to better filter models referencing resource types or node types that do not exist.
    </p>

    <p>
        Finally, when using <a href="/documentation.html#spring">NEBA's Spring integration</a>, the shutdown of bundles with a failed application context start is no longer persistent. Thus,
        if the framework is restarted, it will attempt to start the bundle again, provided its <a href="https://osgi.org/specification/osgi.core/7.0.0/framework.startlevel.html">autostart level</a> is active (which is the default).
        This will make deployments more resilient to temporary failure, e.g. the temporary absence of required configurations or services during an automated deployment.
    </p>
