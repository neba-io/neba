    <p>
        NEBA 5.0.6 ships with a simplified log viewer. Here, we have removed special-case handling of error detection in the logs in favor of the new <a href="https://neba.io/2019/04/15/neba-release-5.0.5.html">grep functionality added in the previous release</a>.
        Since users can search for any regular expression in the log file and the grep functionality has smart stack trace handling, there is no need for error-specific filtering any more.
    </p>
    <p>
        In addition, the log viewer now allows downloading either the currently viewed or all logfiles, since downloading all logfiles might not be a good idea on larger production deployments.
    </p>

    <p>
        Finally, the optional NEBA Spring integration has been updated to <a href="https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:org.apache.servicemix.bundles%20spring&v:5.1.6.RELEASE_1=">Spring Version 5.1.6</a>, containing <a href="https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/milestone/210?closed=1">multiple important bugfixes and improvements</a>.
    </p>
