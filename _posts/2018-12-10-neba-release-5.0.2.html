    >NEBA 5.0.2 ships with a series of performance improvements derived from profiling sessions on multiple large-scale Sling and AEM deployments.
        The improvements aim to further increase the efficiency of NEBA's <a href="/documentation.html#caching">built-in resource model caching</a> and to reduce the overhead associated with cache lookups and
        lazy loading.
