        NEBA 5.1.5 Resolves an issue with the request-scoped resource model cache introduced in NEBA 5.1.4. This issue
        results in no model instances being returned from an .adaptTo call when the request-scoped resource model cache is unavailable, e.g. is disabled
        or called outside of a request. Users of NEBA 5.1.4 should update tto 5.1.5 as soon as possible.
