<p>
    Usages of @PostConstruct in @ResourceModel beans <em>must</em> be reviewed and must be changed to <a href="/documentation.html#lifecycle_annotations">@AfterMapping</a>
    whenever content-to-object mapping is required for the initialization, e.g. when the initialization relies on mapped members or performs adaptation from resources to spring-based resource
    models.
